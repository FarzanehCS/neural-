# A simple sample for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This is a sample implementaion of the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning".
The Neural-networks-and-deep-learning package is the very basic implementation and the
Neural_Network_Scikit package is the Neural Networks and Deep Learning implementation using scikit_learn and
scipy libraries.


## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
numpy
scikit-learn
scipy


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo



### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
